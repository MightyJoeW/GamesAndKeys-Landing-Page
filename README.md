### What is it?

Games and Keys was created out of the love for video game music as well as the desire to help others grow musically. After creating a piano tutorial for the version of the main theme from The Last of Us that I played in my contest winner, I created a piano tutorial using Synthesia. The tutorial led to many turorial requests for other game themes on Youtube which evolved into a growing collection of tutorials, sheet music, and midi files. 

## Where to find it?
[GamesAndKeys.com](www.gamesandkeys.com) is currently live on Blogger, but I will be moving away from that Blogger site once these new pages are finished.
