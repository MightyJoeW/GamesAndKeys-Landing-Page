# gak-landing-page
GamesAndKeys.com is a site I previously created dedicated to video game piano music. Users can visit the page to watch video game piano tutorials or download sheet music and midi files. 

The site was put together years ago with Blogger, so this Landing Page in the making will eventually the Games and Keys homepage. 

The idea of rebuilding the Games and Keys site came from the freeCodeCamp Landing Page project that I am currently working on.
