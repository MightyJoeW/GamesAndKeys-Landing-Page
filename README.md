# gak-landing-page
GamesAndKeys.com is a website that I created years ago which focused on teaching how to play video game songs on the piano. Users can visit the page to watch video game piano tutorials or download sheet music and midi files. 

The original site was put together in Blogger, so this Landing Page in the making will eventually replace the Games and Keys homepage. 

The idea of rebuilding the GamesAndKeys.com site came from the freeCodeCamp Landing Page project that I am currently working through.
